# Quick Demo Checklist - One Page Reference

## ✅ Pre-Demo (Do This First!)

- [ ] Test: `python main.py` - Make sure it works
- [ ] Test: `python test_run.py` - Quick version works
- [ ] Check visualization appears
- [ ] Practice explaining what you see
- [ ] Have backup (screenshots ready)

## 🎬 5-Minute Demo Script

### 1. Start (30 sec)
```bash
python main.py
```
**Say:** "This is my Dynamic Workload Distribution Algorithm. It balances tasks across 4 processors."

### 2. Show Task Assignment (1 min)
**Point to:** Task assignment messages
**Say:** "Tasks are assigned to the least loaded processor automatically."

### 3. Show System State (1 min)
**Wait for:** 5-second state update
**Point to:** Load percentages, queue lengths
**Say:** "The system monitors all processors and shows balanced loads."

### 4. Show Rebalancing (if occurs) (30 sec)
**Point to:** "[REBALANCING TRIGGERED]" message
**Say:** "When imbalance is detected, tasks are automatically migrated."

### 5. Show Results (1 min)
**Show:** Final performance report
**Say:** "Efficiency is 85-95%. The system maintains optimal balance."

### 6. Show Visualization (30 sec)
**Show:** 4 graphs
**Say:** "Real-time visualization shows processor states and performance."

## 🎯 Key Points to Say

1. **"Dynamic"** - Adapts automatically to load changes
2. **"Real-time"** - Monitors continuously
3. **"Efficient"** - 85-95% load balance efficiency
4. **"Practical"** - Used in cloud computing, web servers

## 🚨 If Something Goes Wrong

**Program won't start:**
- Use backup: `python test_run.py`

**No visualization:**
- "Visualization appears at the end"
- Show console output instead

## 💬 Quick Q&A Answers

**Q: How does it work?**
A: "Tasks assigned to least loaded processor. System monitors continuously. Rebalances when variance > 30%."

**Q: Why this algorithm?**
A: "Simple, effective, prevents overload. Foundation for complex algorithms."

**Q: How does it adapt?**
A: "Threshold adjusts: High load = 20% (aggressive), Low load = 40% (less aggressive)."

**Q: OS relevance?**
A: "Demonstrates CPU scheduling, process distribution, resource management - core OS concepts."
